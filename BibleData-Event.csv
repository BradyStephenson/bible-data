 (Haggai 1:1) 
 
 On the twenty-first of the seventh month, the word of the LORD came by Haggai the 
 prophet saying, ""Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to 
 Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people saying, 'Who 
 is left among you who saw this temple in its former glory? And how do you see it now? Does 
 it not seem to you like nothing in comparison? 'But now take courage, Zerubbabel,' declares 
 the LORD, 'take courage also, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all you people 
 of the land take courage,' declares the LORD, 'and work; for I am with you,' declares the 
 LORD of hosts. 
 (Haggai 2:1-4) 
 
 When the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to 
 the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them, 
 then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak arose and 
 began to rebuild the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and 
 the prophets of God were with them supporting them.
