-ALAMOTH
     -(Literally virgins) .A musical term which appears in 1CH 15:20

     -It appears in the titles of PSA 57:1; 58:1; 59:1; 75:1
     -(it seems to have been used to indicate the kind of ode, or the kind of melody in which the ode should be sung.)
-HIGGAION PSA 92:3
     -(According to Gesenius, it signifies the murmuring tone of a harp, and hence that the music should be rendered in a plaintive manner.) PSA 9:16
     -(Combined with ""Selah,"" it may have been intended to indicate a pause in the vocal music while the instruments rendered an interlude.) PSA 19:14
     -(Mendelssohn translates it ""meditation, thought."" Hence, the music was to be rendered in a mode to promote devout meditation.)
-MAKALATH, MASCHIL, LEANNOTH
     -These terms are found in the titles of PSA 53:1; 88:1
     -(Authorities grope in darkness as to their signification. They may indicate the instruments to be played, or the melody to be sung)
-MASCHIL
     -This musical sign occurs in the titles of PSA 32:1; 42:1; 44:1; 45:1; 52:1; 53:1; 54:1; 55:1; 74:1; 78:1; 88:1; 89:1; 142:1
     -(The meaning is obscure. But its signification where it occurs elsewhere than in the titles of Psalms is equivalent to the English word ""instruction,"" or to become wise by instruction; hence, PSA 47:7: ""Sing ye praises with understanding."")
-MICAHTAM
     -A musical term in the titles of PSA 16:1; 56:1; 57:1; 58:1; 59:1; 60:1

-MUTH-LABBEN
     -In the title of PSA 9:1
     -(Authorities, ancient and modern, differ as to the probable signification. Gesenius and DEU Wette interpret it, ""with the voice of virgins, by boys."" Others derive the word from a different Hebrew root, and interpret it as indicating that the Psalm was a funeral ode.)
-NEGINAH and NEGINOTH
     -Appear in the titles of PSA 4:1; 54:1; 55:1; 61:1; 67:1; HAB 3:19
     -(Its use seems to have been to indicate that the song should be accompanied by stringed instruments.) -NEHILOTH

     -(It seems to indicate, according to Gesenius, that when this Psalm was sung it was to be accompanied by wind instruments.)
-SELAH

     -In the titles of PSA 6:1; 12:1
     -(Translated ""eighth,"" probably indicates the measure, movement, or pitch.)
-SHIGGAION
     -In the title of PSA 7:1

     -(Supposed to be a musical term to guide in rendering the song. At the close of the chapter, the author refers the ode ""to the chief musician, on my stringed instruments."" The term may suggest the movement in interpreting the music set to it.)
-SHOSHANNIM and SHUSHAN-EDUTH .In the titles to PSA 45:1; 60:1; 69:1; 80:1
     -(Seems to indicate the manner in which these Psalms were to be rendered. Kimchi, Tremellius, and Eichhorn render it ""hexachorda,"" that is, that in singing these Psalms instruments of six strings were to accompany.)
