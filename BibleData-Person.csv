Ahinoam_2,Ahinoam,,of Jezreel.  Same as Ahinoam_1? (see 2SA 12:8),female,,"Only one other character named Ahinoam appears in the Hebrew Bible (Saul’s wife; see 1SA 14:50). Because she is roughly a contemporary of David’s wife, it is possible that “Ahinoam of Jezreel” is Saul’s wife Ahinoam. Citing YHWH’s words (via the prophet Nathan) to David, “I gave you … your master’s wives” (2 Sam 12:8), Levenson and Halpern argue that David’s marriage to Ahinoam constituted a claim to Saul’s throne (see Absalom’s actions in 2 Sam 16:22). Perhaps David, like other kings who appropriated the harems of their predecessors or rivals, strengthened his claim to the throne in this way. - Linda Schearing (taken 4/10/2020 from https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/ahinoam-bible)",2,646
