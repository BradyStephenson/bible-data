Information from the Bible as structured data

These datasets are actively maintained and available at the data.world website 
at https://data.world/bradys

# SUMMARY
Read by students, scholars, critics, and the curious for millennia, the Holy 
Bible is the most translated, most widely published, and most examined text in 
history.  Unfortunately, the *information* in Scripture largely has remained 
unstructured and not easily parsed, examined, processed, or enriched with modern 
technology.  

Want to create a graph database and identify how many descendants of Aaron are 
named in the Bible or how many generations are named between Adam and King 
David?  Want to run a query to discover how many years it was between the Flood 
and the creation of Solomon's temple?  Need a list of all the Biblical events 
that occurred at a specific geographic location?  Structured data makes all of 
these (and more!) possible.
