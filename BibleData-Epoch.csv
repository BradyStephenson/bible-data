His account, preserved in fragments, describes Evil-Merodach’s rule as ""lawless and outrageous,"" leading to his overthrow after a short reign. This aligns with the two-year timeframe.
- Abydenus, another ancient historian, is referenced in the McClintock and Strong Biblical Cyclopedia as assigning Evil-Merodach a reign of two years. His works, though surviving only in fragments, corroborate Berossus’ account of the brief rule ending with Neriglissar’s usurpation.
- The Canon of Ptolemy, a chronological list of kings, records Evil-Merodach (under the name Ilvoradam or similar) as reigning for two years, from 562 to 560 BCE. This astronomical and historical document is considered a reliable source for Babylonian chronology.
- Approximately 30 cuneiform contract tablets dated to Evil-Merodach’s reign have been discovered, covering a period of about two years and five months (562–560 BCE). These tablets, used for economic transactions, provide direct evidence of his rule’s duration, as they cease after August 560 BCE, when Neriglissar’s documents appear.
- The Uruk King List, a cuneiform document, records the reigns of Babylonian kings. While it does not provide detailed narratives, it confirms Evil-Merodach’s reign as brief, consistent with the two-year period noted in other sources.

This suggests Belshazzar acted as co-regent or ruler in Babylon from around 553 BCE until the fall of Babylon in 539 BCE, implying a period of about 14 years. The chronicle does not explicitly state the duration but provides key chronological markers.
- The Verse Account of Nabonidus (Cuneiform Text, 6th Century BCE), a propagandistic cuneiform text, likely composed after the Persian conquest, describes Nabonidus’ absence from Babylon and his delegation of authority to his son (presumably Belshazzar). It aligns with the Nabonidus Chronicle, indicating Belshazzar’s rule began around Nabonidus’ third year (553 BCE) and continued until 539 BCE, supporting a roughly 14-year period of influence.
- Numerous cuneiform tablets from Babylon, dated to the reign of Nabonidus, mention Belshazzar in roles of authority, such as overseeing transactions or military matters. These tablets span from around 553 BCE (Nabonidus’ third year) to 539 BCE, suggesting Belshazzar’s active rule or co-regency during this period. While they do not explicitly state a reign length, the consistent references over these years imply about 14 years of prominence.
- Herodotus, in his Histories (Book 1), does not directly name Belshazzar but refers to a Babylonian king (possibly Belshazzar or Nabonidus) during the fall of Babylon in 539 BCE. He does not provide a reign length, but his account aligns with the timeline of Babylonian rule ending in 539 BCE, consistent with Belshazzar’s final year as co-regent.
- In his Cyropaedia, Xenophon describes the fall of Babylon and mentions a young king ruling at the time, likely Belshazzar. While he does not specify the length of the reign, his narrative supports the timeline of 539 BCE as the end of Belshazzar’s rule, corroborating other sources that place Belshazzar in power during Nabonidus’ later years.
- Berossus, as cited by later authors like Josephus, describes the final years of Babylonian rule and mentions Belshazzar (under the name ""Nabonnedus’ son"") as ruling when Babylon fell to Cyrus in 539 BCE. While Berossus does not explicitly state the duration of Belshazzar’s rule, his account implies a shorter period of authority under Nabonidus, consistent with the co-regency starting around 553 BCE.

However, 2KI 14:23 states Jereboam became king in the FIFTEENTH YEAR of Amaziah (3166 + 15 - 1 year duration overcount = 3180).
HOW CAN IT BE BOTH?
The year Amaziah died (3195) was FIFTEEN YEARS *AFTER* the death of Jehoash (2KI 14:17) which means Jehoash' death occurred in 3195 - 15 = 3180 (math).

The Nabonidus Chronicle, Babylonian contract tablets, and Ptolemy’s Canon, combined with Herodotus (Histories 1.46–214) and Berossus (via Josephus), indicate Cyrus became king of Anshan (a precursor to his Persian rule) around 559 BCE. This marks the beginning of his reign over the Persian tribes before his conquests of Media, Lydia, and Babylon.
[Ussher date p111]*EXTRA-BIBLICAL SOURCE:
The Nabonidus Chronicle, a Babylonian cuneiform text, documents the reign of Nabonidus, Belshazzar’s father, from 556 to 539 BCE. It notes that Nabonidus entrusted the kingship to Belshazzar in his third year (ca. 553 BCE) while Nabonidus was in Tema (Arabia). This suggests Belshazzar acted as co-regent or ruler in Babylon from around 553 BCE until the fall of Babylon in 539 BCE, implying a period of about 14 years. 
[Shulman date p143]
[Ussher date p113]*EXTRA-BIBLICAL SOURCES:
- The Nabonidus Chronicle, a Babylonian cuneiform document, explicitly records the fall of Babylon to Cyrus in the 17th year of Nabonidus’ reign, which corresponds to 539 BCE. It describes Cyrus’ army entering Babylon without a battle in the month of Tishri (October) 539 BCE, after defeating Babylonian forces at Opis.  This is the most precise and authoritative source for dating Cyrus’ conquest to 539 BCE.
- The Cyrus Cylinder, a propagandistic cuneiform document, details Cyrus’ capture of Babylon and his claim to legitimate rule. While it does not provide an exact year, it describes his peaceful entry into Babylon and restoration of temples, aligning with the Nabonidus Chronicle’s account of 539 BCE.
- Cuneiform economic and administrative tablets from Babylon show a transition in dating formulas from Nabonidus’ reign to Cyrus’ reign in 539 BCE. Tablets dated to Nabonidus cease in October 539 BCE, and those dated to “Year 1 of Cyrus, King of Babylon” begin shortly after, confirming the conquest and start of his reign in 539 BCE. These records provide precise chronological evidence.
- The Canon of Ptolemy, a chronological list of kings used for astronomical calculations, records Cyrus as ruler of Babylon starting in 538/539 BCE (following Nabonidus’ 17-year reign). While compiled later, it relies on earlier Babylonian records and aligns with the Nabonidus Chronicle, placing Cyrus’ accession over Babylon in 539 BCE.
- In his Histories (Book 1.178–191), Herodotus describes Cyrus’ conquest of Babylon, including diverting the Euphrates River to enter the city. While he does not provide a specific year, his narrative aligns with the Babylonian timeline of 539 BCE, as it follows Cyrus’ earlier conquests (e.g., Lydia in 546 BCE) and precedes later Persian campaigns. His account supports the general chronology established by Babylonian sources.
- Xenophon’s Cyropaedia (Book 7) recounts Cyrus’ capture of Babylon, describing a nighttime assault during a festival. Like Herodotus, Xenophon does not specify a year, but his narrative is consistent with the 539 BCE conquest described in Babylonian records, reinforcing the timeline.
- Berossus, as cited by later authors like Josephus (Against Apion 1.20), describes Cyrus’ conquest of Babylon after defeating Nabonidus. He does not explicitly state 539 BCE, but his account of Cyrus’ victory and rule over Babylon aligns with the Nabonidus Chronicle’s timeline, supporting the start of Cyrus’ reign in 539 BCE.

- The Behistun Inscription, a monumental rock relief and trilingual cuneiform inscription, commissioned by Darius I, details his rise to power. It describes how Darius, a Persian noble, overthrew Gaumata (a Magian usurper claiming to be Bardiya, son of Cyrus) in 522 BCE, thus becoming king.
- The Babylonian Contract Tablets, economic and administrative tablets from Babylon record transactions dated by regnal years of Persian kings. Tablets dated to “Year 1 of Darius” begin in late 522 BCE, after those dated to Bardiya (March–September 522 BCE).
- The Canon of Ptolemy, a chronological list of kings used for astronomical calculations, lists Darius I as succeeding Cambyses II and Bardiya, with his reign beginning in 522/521 BCE.
- In his Histories (Book 3.61–88), Herodotus narrates Darius’ rise to power, describing how he and six Persian nobles conspired to overthrow the usurper “Smerdis” (Gaumata, posing as Bardiya) in 522 BCE.
- In his Persica, Ctesias offers an alternative account of Persian history, preserved in fragments by later authors like Photius. He mentions Darius’ rise after Cambyses but includes less reliable details.

[Ussher date p160]  Malachi, the last of the prophets, was contemporary with Nehemiah. This we gather from the following. He nowhere exhorts the people to build the temple as Haggai and Zechariah did.  Since the Temple was now built, he reproved those disorders among the Jews which Nehemiah at his second return with a new commission did also. These are, the marriage with foreign women, Mal 2:11 withholding of tithes, Mal 3:8 and abuses in the worship of God. Mal 1:13 2:8.Most scholars identify Ahasuerus in Esther with Xerxes I (486–465 BCE). The description of his vast empire (127 provinces in EST 1:1) and opulent court aligns with Herodotus’ portrayal of Xerxes’ wealth and campaigns (Histories 7–9). The Greek form of Xerxes (Xerxes) matches the Hebrew Achashverosh via the Old Persian Xšayārša.  The account of the book of Esther, with its Persian court intrigue and reference to Susa (Shushan), fits Xerxes I’s reign.  No ancient sources explicitly name Xerxes as Ahasuerus, but the linguistic and historical fit is strong. The absence of precise dates in Esther allows flexibility, but Xerxes I is the consensus.  Xerxes I preceded Artaxerxes I, his son. Thus, Ahasuerus (Xerxes I) in Esther is not the same person as Artaxerxes in Ezra or Nehemiah.

EXTRA-BIBLICAL SOURCES:
Babylonian contract tablets dated to Darius I’s reign (522–486 BCE) cease in late 486 BCE (around October/November), and tablets dated to “Year 1 of Xerxes, King of Persia and Media” begin shortly thereafter, marking his accession in late 486 BCE. The transition is seamless, indicating Xerxes’ immediate recognition as king.
[Shulman date p143]
[Ussher date p119]*EXTRA-BIBLICAL SOURCES:
- Babylonian contract tablets dated to “Year 21 of Xerxes” appear until mid-465 BCE (around August), after which tablets dated to “Year 1 of Artaxerxes” begin, indicating Xerxes’ death in the summer of 465 BCE. Some tablets note a brief period of instability, possibly due to the assassination.
- Ptolemy’s Canon lists Xerxes I’s reign as 21 years, ending in 465 BCE, with Artaxerxes I succeeding him.
- In his Library of History (Book 11.69), Diodorus provides a later account of Xerxes’ assassination, attributing it to Artabanus, who briefly usurped power before Artaxerxes I’s rise.
- The Persepolis Fortification and Treasury Tablets are administrative records continue under Xerxes until his death until mid-465 BCE, after which Artaxerxes I’s tablets begin.  This transition supports Xerxes’ death in 465 BCE.

Josephus records that Samuel judged for THIRTY-TWO YEARS.  Since Saul's reign took up twelve of those thirty-two years, then Samuel's time as a judge before the reign of Saul would have taken up the remaining twenty.  Samuel's remaining time as judge would have overlapped Saul's time as king for ten of Saul's twelve-year reign.

[Ussher date p70]*HYPOTHESIS:
Tibni and Omri began a disputed reign over Israel at the same time.  Omri is stated to have ruled TWELVE years (total) with SIX undisputed in Tirzah.  This leaves SIX years of his reign disputed with Omri.  Also, Israel and Judah counted the years of a king's reign differently than the other and also began their calendar year on different days.  These two factors need to be considered when calculating this date.  See dataset notes for more information.

[Ussher date p160]  Malachi, the last of the prophets, was contemporary with Nehemiah. This we gather from the following. He nowhere exhorts the people to build the temple as Haggai and Zechariah did.  Since the Temple was now built, he reproved those disorders among the Jews which Nehemiah at his second return with a new commission did also. These are, the marriage with foreign women, Mal 2:11 withholding of tithes, Mal 3:8 and abuses in the worship of God. Mal 1:13 2:8.

Reign_of_Ahasuerus,The reign of Ahasuerus,Ahasuerus reigned after Cyrus for 14 years: 532-519 BCE.,Reign,Ahasuerus_1,3476,3497,21,The year Ahasuerus's reign began is the year Darius' reign ended = 3476,,,The year Ahasuerus's reign ended is the year his reign began (3476)  + the length of his reign (21) years = 3497,,,"START:Most scholars identify Ahasuerus in Esther with Xerxes I (486–465 BCE). The description of his vast empire (127 provinces in EST 1:1) and opulent court aligns with Herodotus’ portrayal of Xerxes’ wealth and campaigns (Histories 7–9). The Greek form of Xerxes (Xerxes) matches the Hebrew Achashverosh via the Old Persian Xšayārša.  The account of the book of Esther, with its Persian court intrigue and reference to Susa (Shushan), fits Xerxes I’s reign.  No ancient sources explicitly name Xerxes as Ahasuerus, but the linguistic and historical fit is strong. The absence of precise dates in Esther allows flexibility, but Xerxes I is the consensus.  Xerxes I preceded Artaxerxes I, his son. Thus, Ahasuerus (Xerxes I) in Esther is not the same person as Artaxerxes in Ezra or Nehemiah.

EXTRA-BIBLICAL SOURCES:
Babylonian contract tablets dated to Darius I’s reign (522–486 BCE) cease in late 486 BCE (around October/November), and tablets dated to “Year 1 of Xerxes, King of Persia and Media” begin shortly thereafter, marking his accession in late 486 BCE. The transition is seamless, indicating Xerxes’ immediate recognition as king.
[Shulman date p143]
[Ussher date p119]
END:*EXTRA-BIBLICAL SOURCES:
- Babylonian contract tablets dated to “Year 21 of Xerxes” appear until mid-465 BCE (around August), after which tablets dated to “Year 1 of Artaxerxes” begin, indicating Xerxes’ death in the summer of 465 BCE. Some tablets note a brief period of instability, possibly due to the assassination.
- Ptolemy’s Canon lists Xerxes I’s reign as 21 years, ending in 465 BCE, with Artaxerxes I succeeding him.
- Herodotus’ Histories does not explicitly describe Xerxes’ death, as his account focuses on the Greek wars (480–479 BCE) and ended before 465 BCE.
- In his Persica, preserved in fragments by later authors like Photius, Ctesias describes Xerxes’ assassination by a courtier, Artabanus, in a palace conspiracy.
- In his Library of History (Book 11.69), Diodorus provides a later account of Xerxes’ assassination, attributing it to Artabanus, who briefly usurped power before Artaxerxes I’s rise.
- The Persepolis Fortification and Treasury Tablets are administrative records continue under Xerxes until his death until mid-465 BCE, after which Artaxerxes I’s tablets begin.  This transition supports Xerxes’ death in 465 BCE.
